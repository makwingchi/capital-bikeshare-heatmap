## Overview
The web application will generate a heatmap of aggregate bike trips throughout Washington DC from a selection station,
answering the question of "where do people bike from here". All the data are provided by
Capital Bikeshare and are from the second half of 2020. Each region roughly represents
the area within half a mile from the bikeshare station (i.e. places people would walk from/to).
